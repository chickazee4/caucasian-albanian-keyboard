This repository contains a [klfc](https://github.com/39aldo39/klfc)-compatible keyboard layout for the Caucasian Albanian alphabet, including all letters attested by the Sinai palimpsests team. It is QWERTY-based and also corresponds in part to the standard Georgian layout. 

## To install
Simply install klfc from the link above and follow the directions there to convert the layout from JSON to your chosen format (xkb if on Linux, probably best klc if on Windows), then use the generated install script.
